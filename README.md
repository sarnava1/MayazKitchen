This was a project I was building when I was learning web development nicely with dedication for the first time. It only has bootstrap, css and html. It was very poorly organized at first but now it is clean and clear.

1. index.html is the starting index file. 
2. I was learning web d when I was creating the project so no formal rules have been followed here. I am extremely sorry for this.
3. All the images used are in Images folder.
4. All the css files used are in styles folder.
5. All other HTML files are in the htmlfiles folder.
6. All the files are made using basic html and bootstrap and very less js is used.
7. I have used the W3 schools for my learning of bootstrap and a lot of examples from there are used.
8. Few files are also directly taken from open source projects with modifications of my own.
9. There will be a hell lot of issues in this project.
10. First timers and noobies can try solving the issues over here. It will lead to their betterment.
